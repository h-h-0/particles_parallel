# Parallelizing a simulation of particles moving in a 2D box.
A simple project that applies parallelization, using `mpi4py`, to a program that simulates particles moving in a box. It uses the RK4 algorithm to solve the PDE (equation of motion) by resolving it into two ODEs. Auxilary files are in `src/`. The main code file is `sim.py`, in the main directory.
